# Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-In-Vitro-Drug-Release-from-PLGA-Microparticles

This repository contains a machine learning study analyzing in vitro drug release behavior from Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microparticles. It includes the written paper describing the methodology and findings, a Jupyter notebook containing all code used for data processing and modeling, and the processed dataset used in the analysis.

## Contents

- **Paper**  
  The accompanying paper documents the motivation, dataset, modeling strategy, and conclusions of the study.

- **Jupyter Notebook (`FormulationAnalyses.ipynb`)**  
  Contains all code cells required to:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset  
  - Train and evaluate machine learning models  
  - Generate figures and results discussed in the paper  

- **Dataset (`mp_dataset_processed.xlsx`)**  
  Processed formulation and release dataset used as the sole input to the modeling workflow.
